		<h2> About me</h2>
		<p>Engineering is more than designing systems—it’s about understanding how machines, people, and data interact to create seamless, efficient operations. That’s what drives me.</p>
		<p>I first discovered industrial automation through a fascination with robotics. After completing my electronics technician program at BCIT, I realized I wanted a deeper understanding of how systems work. When I transitioned into automation, everything just clicked—the ability to control how things actuate, how mechanical, electrical, instrumentation, and software all integrate. I knew I had found my calling.</p>
		<p>Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside world-class engineers who have shaped my approach to automation—not just getting the job done, but getting it done right. A great system isn’t just functional; it’s designed with every user in mind—from operators and maintenance teams to decision-makers relying on data-driven insights. The best solutions don’t come from rushing through a problem but fully understanding it—leveraging every component to create an optimized, intelligent system.</p>
		<p>Controls engineering holds a special place in my heart because it builds on solid principles, allowing systems to operate at their full potential with the right level of planning. My philosophy? Engineering is never just about technology. It’s about viewing each system from multiple perspectives, ensuring that every solution delivers reliability, usability, and performance for everyone involved.</p>
<p>I built this site as a streamlined way to share my experience and professional background. If you’d like to discuss projects, collaboration, or automation challenges, feel free to reach out.</p>
